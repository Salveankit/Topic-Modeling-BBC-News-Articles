## Introduction
This repository contains the code and documentation for a project on topic modeling using unsupervised machine learning algorithms on a collection of BBC news articles. The goal of this project is to identify major themes or topics present in the news articles and assess their correspondence with the different tags available.

## Business Context
In this project, we aim to discover and analyze significant themes across various BBC news segments, including business, entertainment, politics, sports, and technology. By leveraging clustering algorithms like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), we intend to provide insights for content recommendation, trend analysis, and understanding user interests in the news domain.

## Dataset Description
The dataset consists of news articles categorized into different segments. The segments are business, entertainment, politics, sports, and technology. The raw data is available in [data folder](data/) in CSV format. We will create an aggregate dataset by combining all the news articles for topic modeling.
